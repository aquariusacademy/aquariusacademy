# Aquarius Academy

[Aquarius Academy](https://aquarius.academy) is a collective of consciousness and an online education center that catalyzes consciousness through mind/body/spirit training. Founded in 2016, our mission is to guide individuals towards self-actualization and a vibrant life, helping them radiate a special kind of light that activates others and co-creates a better world.

## Our Offering

We provide a multitude of resources to assist in your journey:

* **Guidance for Starseeds:** We offer guidance to tune into galactic love and wisdom.
* **Courses for Students:** Our students learn to hone their consciousness, see through the Matrix of modern life, and combine their internal control and external understanding to create true magic.
* **Fractal Lessons:** Our top padawans teach real-life starseeds as part of their journey, and Jedi Masters and existing teachers can share their courses, like a spiritual version of Skillshare.
* **Online Courses:** We offer free access to video courses that help you explore your consciousness and understand the permeation of consciousness throughout the universe.
